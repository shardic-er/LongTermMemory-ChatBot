# Project Super Prompt: Long-Term Memory Chatbot Architecture Plan

## Introduction
This document serves as a comprehensive guide and reference for the development team to understand, build, and maintain the Long-Term Memory Chatbot system. It captures the architectural decisions, component interactions, and the high-level plan for implementation.

## System Overview
The system integrates a long-term memory feature into a conversational AI using OpenAI's APIs for conversation and embeddings, a PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension for storing and retrieving embeddings, and a user interface created with React.

## Core Components

### 1. Conversational AI
- **Purpose**: Handle the generation of conversational responses using the ChatGPT API.
- **Interaction**: Receives prompts from the frontend, retrieves relevant context from the database, and sends data to the OpenAI API for response generation.

### 2. Embedding Generation
- **Purpose**: Convert chat messages into vector embeddings for storage and retrieval.
- **Primary Tool**: OpenAI's Embeddings API (fallback or alternative: Hugging Face Transformers).
- **Interaction**: Processes messages from the Conversational AI and stores the generated embeddings in the database.

### 3. Database
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension.
- **Purpose**: Persistently store message embeddings and provide efficient vector search capabilities.
- **Interaction**: Receives and retrieves embeddings to and from the Embedding Generation and Search components.

### 4. Embedding Search
- **Primary Tool**: Scikit-learn for initial development (with options to integrate Faiss or Annoy later).
- **Purpose**: Retrieve the most relevant embeddings from the database based on the current conversation context.
- **Interaction**: Queries the database upon each new user message to find contextually relevant historical embeddings.

### 5. Summarization
- **Primary Tool**: OpenAI's GPT model via API for summarization.
- **Purpose**: Generate concise summaries from retrieved historical chat messages to provide context to the conversational AI.
- **Interaction**: Summarizes content from the Embedding Search results and feeds it into the conversational context.

### 6. Backend API
- **Framework**: FastAPI.
- **Purpose**: Serve as the backend server handling API requests from the frontend and interacting with all other backend components.
- **Interaction**: Manages communication between the frontend, Conversational AI, Embedding Generation, Database, and Summarization components.

### 7. Frontend Application
- **Framework**: React.
- **Purpose**: Provide the user interface for interaction with the conversational AI.
- **Interaction**: Sends user inputs to the Backend API and displays responses from the Conversational AI.

### 8. Deployment
- **Technologies**: Docker, Heroku, GitHub Actions.
- **Purpose**: Ensure the application is containerized, deployed, and continuously integrated with updates.

## Data Flow

1. **User Message**: A user sends a message through the frontend.
2. **Embedding Generation**: The message is sent to the backend, where it's converted into an embedding using the chosen tool.
3. **Database Storage**: The embedding is stored in the PostgreSQL database.
4. **Context Retrieval**: For new messages, the system retrieves relevant past embeddings using the search component.
5. **Summarization**: Summaries of the historical context are generated.
6. **Conversational Context**: The summarized context is combined with the new user message to form the updated conversational context.
7. **Response Generation**: The conversational AI generates a response using the OpenAI API with the updated context.
8. **Display Response**: The frontend displays the generated response to the user.

## Experimentation and Scalability

- The system design allows for the replacement of search algorithms and summarization methods.
- Each component can be scaled independently, accommodating increased load and data volume.
- The ability to switch out components also provides an opportunity to test different technologies and approaches to improve system performance.

## Development Phases

1. **Prototype**: A minimal viable product with core functionalities to demonstrate the concept.
2. **Iteration**: Refine the system, improve the performance of search and summarization, and user experience enhancements.
3. **Scalability**: Optimize the system for larger-scale deployments, potentially moving to cloud-based managed services for greater scalability.
4. **Maintenance**: Establish a process for regular updates, security patches, and performance tuning.
